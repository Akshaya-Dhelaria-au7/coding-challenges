1) In python, the size of float and integer is the same in terms of bytes then how is it able to store such large values?
Since Float translates the value into the smaller form for example 36796775533267867996501111168. In float it stores this value as 3.6*10^30.


2) How many bits are there in 1GB and 1MB?
1 MB will have 1024*1024*8= 8388608 bits.
1 GB will have 1024*1024*1024*8= 8589934592 bits.
