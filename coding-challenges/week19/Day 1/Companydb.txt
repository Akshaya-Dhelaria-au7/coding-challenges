Command: select  emp_id,name,deparments from compnydb cross join department;


Output: 
 emp_id |  name   |        deparments

2. Inner join: It takes 2 tables and if they find a foreign key, a new table is created out of that. For example, there is a table X and another table Y. If they have same foreign key, a new table will be created on that basis like table Z.

Command: select  emp_id,name,deparments from compnydb inner join department on compnydb.id=department.emp_id;

OR

Command: select  emp_id,name,deparments from compnydb join department on compnydb.id=department.emp_id;

OR

Command: SELECT * FROM compnydb join department ON compnydb.id=department.emp_id;

Output:
 emp_id |  name   |        deparments         
--------+---------+---------------------------
      1 | akshay  | Sales
